# PENDING - Website Restructure Proposal

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Hero (keep current Ken Burns slideshow)

### 2. Services Section (NEW)
Four clear service pillars:

| Service | What It Covers |
|---------|----------------|
| **Data Engineering** | Scalable cloud pipelines, plug & play frameworks, AI-ready data. ETL/ELT, geospatial warehousing, data cleaning & harmonization |
| **Geospatial AI** | Satellite ML models, temporal forecasting, environmental indicators. Wildfire, flood, snow, species distribution, carbon mapping |
| **Connectivity & Graphs** | Ecological corridor analysis, fragmentation metrics (ECA/ΔECA), resistance networks, habitat connectivity |
| **Visors & Dashboards** | Custom web mapping applications, no-code data export tools, interactive geospatial visualization |

### 3. Industries Section (NEW)
Who you serve - grouped into 4 cards:

| Industry | Markets |
|----------|---------|
| **Conservation & Biodiversity** | National parks, forestry agencies, Natura 2000, habitat restoration NGOs |
| **Climate Risk & Restoration** | Fire agencies, carbon MRV, reforestation, post-fire restoration |
| **Agriculture & Land** | Precision farming, AgTech, soil restoration, drought monitoring |
| **Infrastructure** | Mining, civil engineering, ski resorts, cartography |

### 4. Projects (keep - as case studies)

### 5. Team (keep)

### 6. Partners (keep)
